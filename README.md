## 🛠️ Professional Expertise (Cloud Operations)
Currently at **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)**, I manage high-availability infrastructure for enterprise-scale e-commerce platform (Woolworths).

* **Orchestration & Scaling:** Manage high-availability **Kubernetes (K8s)** clusters via **Rancher**. Lead weekly **Blue-Green deployment** rotations by proactively scaling PODs in inactive clusters to ensure 100% capacity before traffic cutover.
* **Full-Stack Observability:** Expert use of **Dynatrace** to monitor critical KPIs including failure rates (4xx/5xx), response times, and throughput. Implement **Synthetic health checks** and routine service "spotting" to ensure endpoint availability.
* **Data Operations & RCA:** Perform Root Cause Analysis (RCA) on complex order flows using **MongoDB** queries, correlating Shopper IDs to Order IDs to pinpoint invoice PDF locations for auditing and troubleshooting.
* **Automation & Pipelines:** Monitor search and pricing ingestion graphs via **Apache Airflow** (message count tracking and throughput validation). Manage **Azure DevOps** release libraries and deployment block approvals for frontend/backend service updates.

## 🔬 Research & Academic Projects
* **AI-Driven Smart Parking:** Designed an IoT/Cloud system using **LSTM-based AI** on AWS Lambda. **Presented at IEEE ICUIS 2025**.
* **Autonomous UAV Networks:** Proposed an AI-driven framework for autonomous communication relays. **Published in IJARCCE**.
* **ECOVAL (Wildlife IoT):** Led a 5-member team to design a detection system using **OpenCV** and AWS Cloud.
